# Classifying-waste-using-computer-vision

## About the project
The project aim to utilize computer vision capabilities in Python to classify waste via image data. In particular, it will experiment with the tensorflow library to create a few neural network-based machine learning model for the task.

One important note is that the project will be done using Google Colab as a platform and will only use its free version without incurring any additional cost. This means that the project will be limited in available processing and computing power.

For this reason, only 3 model architectures were covered in the experiment. This would also impact the number of tweaks made to hyper-parameters later in fine-tuning stage. More details on this matter will be discussed in "The development process" section
